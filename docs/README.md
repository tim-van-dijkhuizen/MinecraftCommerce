_Due to lack of time and motivation, I will no longer develop new major features. As of now, I will still be fixing bugs, updating the plugin and making minor improvements. This project was started as a proof of concept and even though I'm happy with the results, there isn't much people who can use this plugin. The plugin is open-source, so feel free to continue developing this project for your own personal use._

### Developer API
The developer API allows you to extend MinecraftCommerce. You should only interact with the plugin through its public API: `nl.timvandijkhuizen.commerce.CommerceApi`. I recommend that you use my [SpigotUtils](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spigotutils.86830/) plugin API. This utility plugin helps you develop better plugins with less code.

##### Where should I place my code?
All extensions should be registered before MinecraftCommerce is initiated. To do this you must either register them from `onLoad()` or `setup()` if you're using the plugin API from SpigotUtils.

##### What can I do with the API?
* [Custom storage types](api/STORAGE_TYPES.md)
* [Custom field types](api/FIELD_TYPES.md)
* [Custom gateway types](api/GATEWAY_TYPES.md)
* [Custom order variables](api/ORDER_VARIABLES.md)
* [Custom order effects](api/ORDER_EFFECTS.md)
* [Custom template resolvers](api/TEMPLATE_RESOLVERS.md)
